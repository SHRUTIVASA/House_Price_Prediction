        <p class="card-text" style="padding-left: 15%; padding-right: 0%">
          NoBroker is one of the online real estate websites which is popular for rental than a sale. It connects property owners directly with property seekers.

This business model works better in the rental segment because only in rental segment tenant gives brokerage whereas in buying segment developer will take care of agent brokerage not imposed on end buyer.

No broker’s revenue model is also completely different from other established portals.

In other real estate websites, advertisers (property owners) have to pay to list out their properties and the end user can contact them for free whereas in Nobroker property owners can list out their property for free and end user has to pay a premium to view contacts.

Really one of the popular and useful real estate websites for the rental segment.<br /><button
